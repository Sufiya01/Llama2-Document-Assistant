# Llama2-Document-Assistant
Description
An AI-powered document assistant that uses Llama 2, LangChain, and FAISS to provide intelligent question-answering based on custom documents. This project processes PDF files, converts them into vector embeddings, and leverages a powerful retrieval-based approach for answering queries using pre-trained language models. Designed to efficiently handle large text data and provide context-aware, precise responses.

Key Features
PDF Parsing: Extracts content from PDF documents.
Text Chunking: Splits large text into manageable chunks for processing.
Vector Database: Stores text embeddings using FAISS for fast retrieval.
Custom Query Responses: Uses a pre-trained Llama 2 model to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
GPU/CPU Support: Optimized for both CUDA-enabled GPUs and CPUs.
Easy Integration: Modular code with reusable functions for extending functionality.
This project is ideal for creating domain-specific document assistants in fields like healthcare, legal, education, and more.
